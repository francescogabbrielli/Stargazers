# Stargazers

A sample GitHub API client implemented with [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)

## Info
The UI is pretty simple: just a search bar, used to find a GitHub repository, with search suggestions on the fly. 
Once found, It shows the list of stargazers for that repository: image and login. Clicking on a stargazer you will be redirected to his GitHub page.
